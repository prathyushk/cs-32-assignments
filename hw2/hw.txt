2. The first 12 coordinates popped off the stack by the algorithm are:
(6,4)
(6,3)
(6,5)
(7,5)
(8,5)
(8,6)
(8,7)
(8,8)
(7,8)
(6,6)
(5,4)
(4,4)

4. The first 12 coordinates popped from the queue by the algorithm are:
(6,4)
(5,4)
(6,5)
(6,3)
(4,4)
(6,6)
(7,5)
(3,4)
(4,5)
(8,5)
(2,4)
(4,6)

The difference is a stack uses a depth first search while a queue is a breadth first search. This means for a stack, since it is LIFO, it will follow each path to the end and work backwards from there, following all of the paths to the end. It follows them to the end because the last item on the queue will be the most recently pushed item so before processing all of the surrounding spots for one coordinate, it will go to the surrounding of the next coordinate first until it hits the end or a dead end. Only then will it go back to one of the other paths and then follow that to the end as well. For a queue, it follows one layer at a time in a breadth first search. It checks the surrounding places, then those that surround the surrounding places, etc. until it finds the end. This is because it processes the coordinates in the order they are pushed on. So, the surrounding coordinates of the first starting point are all processed and only then are the points that surround those get processed.
